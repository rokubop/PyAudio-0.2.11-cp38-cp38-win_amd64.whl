PyAudio 0.2.11 for Windows 64-bit, built for Python 3.8.

This wheel is required for Windows users running [parrot.py](https://github.com/chaosparrot/parrot.py) with Python 3.8.

Previously, this version of PyAudio was publicly available on [Gohlke's Pythonlibs](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio), but it is no longer hosted there. This file was retrieved using the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) from a March 2023 snapshot of the site.

As of now, this `.whl` file **is no longer publicly available anywhere**, which is why it is provided here for users who still need it.
